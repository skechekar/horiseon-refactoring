# HORISEON REFACTORING

## Description

I edited non-semantic HTML code and added semantic tags and alt image attributes in order to make the site more accessible and up to date with HTML5 standards. I made changes to the CSS so that it matched up with the new semantic HTML and also added comments to the stylesheet so that it is properly organised and inspecting elements is now more efficient. 

## Usage

The deployed site can be accessed via [here](https://skechekar.github.io/horiseon-refactoring/). The DevTools console on Google Chrome can be brought up by using Command+Option+I on MACOS or Control+Shift+I on Windows. 

## Credits

I referred to [this](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) tutorial on W3Schools about semantic HTML elements.
